# Known Limitations

## Purpose

This document records known limitations of the current pipeline so later issues
do not need to rediscover them.

## Structural Binding Limitations

### `xs:choice` Is Not Enforced As Mutual Exclusivity

- Affected areas include:
  - `FlexibleDatesType`
  - `OfficialIdType`
  - `EntityTypeType`
  - `EntityNameType`
- Impact:
  - generated Pydantic models may accept states that are invalid with respect to
    the source XSD
- Expected follow-up:
  - issue `#14` should define policy
  - issue `#15` should restore domain-facing semantics

### `minOccurs` Is Not Enforced For Generated Lists

- Generated list fields with `default_factory=list` do not enforce the minimum
  cardinality implied by the XSD
- Impact:
  - empty lists may be accepted in object construction even when the XSD
    expects at least one element
- Expected follow-up:
  - issue `#14` and issue `#15`

### Some Attributes Are Typed As `object`

- Seen in parts of `specification_manual` and `tree_model`
- Impact:
  - validation is weaker than the XSD suggests
  - ergonomics are worse for downstream code
- Expected follow-up:
  - issue `#14` and issue `#15`

### XML Helper Types Are Less Ergonomic Than Primitives

- Wrappers such as `CVN_duration`, `CVN_gYear`, and `CVN_gYearMonth` map to XML
  helper types such as `XmlDuration` and `XmlPeriod`
- Impact:
  - structural fidelity is preserved, but programmatic usage is more delicate
- Expected follow-up:
  - issue `#14` and issue `#15`

## Generation Process Limitations

### `tree_model` Needs A Target-Specific xsdata Override

- Default structural generation hit circular dependency problems
- Current workaround:
  - `--unnest-classes`
- Impact:
  - generation is reproducible, but not uniform across all three targets
- Expected follow-up:
  - keep documented through issue `#17`

## Canonical Source Package Inconsistencies

### `CVNTreeModel.xml` Diverges From `CVNTreeModel_v1.0.xsd`

- Confirmed discrepancy:
  - the XML includes `<Type>` inside `Indicator`
  - the XSD only declares `Value` and `Child` inside `Indicator`
- Practical consequence:
  - the generated `tree_model` binding is correct with respect to the XSD, but
    cannot fully parse the canonical XML file
- Parse status:
  - `SpecificationManual.xml`: parse OK
  - `CVNTreeModel.xml`: parse blocked by XML/XSD mismatch
- Expected follow-up:
  - issue `#13` must treat the tree-model XML as a source of truth for
    normalization even when the XSD does not describe it completely

## Documentation Rule

Whenever a new limitation is discovered, add it here and reference the issue
expected to address it.
